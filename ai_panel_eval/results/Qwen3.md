  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis clearly identifies underperforming aspects using concrete F1-score data, which makes the root cause understandable and evidence-based. The plan directly addresses the diagnosed issues with actionable steps focused on analysis and iterative improvement. While some terms like 'ART' and 'capability_gap_analysis' are unclear, the overall logic from diagnosis to plan is strong. Since this case provides a solid foundation for improvement without ambiguity, it can proceed as-is."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 5
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Approve for Deployment"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis clearly explains the root cause — the system's difficulty with nuanced and less frequent aspects like 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' — and supports it with relevant evidence including F1-scores, illustrative examples, and agent feedback. The proposed ART is well-explained and directly addresses the identified capability gap by incorporating contextual understanding. The execution plan is coherent, targeted, and strategic, offering both analysis and improvement steps. All components align logically, making this case actionable without requiring further clarification."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 5
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Approve for Deployment"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis clearly identifies the root cause — the system's reliance on direct term mentions and lack of contextual understanding — which is well-supported by F1-scores, illustrative examples, and agent feedback. The proposed ART, ContextualAspectExtractor, directly addresses this gap with a clear explanation of how it improves identification of nuanced aspects. The execution plan is detailed, logical, and aligned with the diagnosis, including actionable steps like prompt engineering and retesting. All elements are understandable and strategically sound, warranting approval without further clarification."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 4
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear, data-backed, and effectively explains the root cause of low performance across key aspects like 'anecdotes/miscellaneous', 'price', and 'service'. The supporting evidence using F1-scores is strong and easy to understand. The execution plan is coherent, actionable, and logically connected to the diagnosis. However, the Proposed ART section is incomplete — it lacks a meaningful name, capability gap analysis, and docstring. Without this, full deployment cannot be approved. Please clarify and complete the ART details before proceeding."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 4
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis clearly explains that the system misses 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' in concise or subtly worded reviews and supports this with specific F1-score data and illustrative examples. The execution plan is logical, targeted, and actionable, focusing on identifying patterns, analyzing feedback, and improving detection through prompt tuning. However, the Proposed ART section is incomplete — it lacks a meaningful name, capability gap analysis, and docstring. Without these, strategic alignment and deployment readiness are uncertain. Please clarify and complete the ART details before proceeding."

  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear, well-supported by F1-score data and system feedback, and effectively explains the root cause of low performance on 'anecdotes/miscellaneous', 'price', and 'service'. The AI-generated performance summary adds valuable context, including a detailed executive summary and actionable next steps. The execution plan is logical, repeatable, and directly aligned with the diagnosis. However, the Proposed ART section remains incomplete — it lacks a meaningful name, capability gap analysis, and docstring. Without these, strategic alignment and deployment readiness are unclear. Please clarify and complete the ART details before proceeding."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 4
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis clearly identifies the root cause of low system performance — poor identification of 'anecdotes/miscellaneous', 'price', and to a lesser extent, 'service' — supported by concrete F1-score data. The execution plan is logical, targeted, and directly tied to addressing the diagnosed issues. However, the Proposed ART section is incomplete, with missing details on capability gap analysis, name, and docstring. This omission prevents full strategic alignment and deployment readiness assessment. Please provide the missing ART information before proceeding."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 5
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Approve for Deployment"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis clearly explains that the system struggles with identifying 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' due to insufficient training data or lack of contextual understanding, supported by F1-score data, illustrative examples, and agent feedback. The proposed ART, ContextualAspectIdentifier, directly addresses this gap by focusing on context rather than keywords. The execution plan is comprehensive, logical, and action-oriented — covering error pattern analysis, prompt tuning, and data review. All components align well from diagnosis to plan, making this case ready for deployment without further clarification."
