# Escalation Case 10

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis details are provided in the sections below (root cause & supporting evidence).


## Root cause hypothesis:

The aspect extraction system struggles to identify 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' due to a lack of training data or an inability to recognize nuanced language and contextual information within reviews. It incorrectly categorizes or misses instances that represent personal stories or isolated incidents, instead focusing on more prominent aspects like service or ambience.


## Supporting evidence:

- The batch summary indicates a low F1-score of 0.5 for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous'.
- Illustrative examples show false negatives where the system fails to identify 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' in review text.
- Review agent feedback highlights the need for the system to consider broader context to differentiate between core aspects and unique situations.
- The system incorrectly predicts 'service' when the actual aspect is 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' (result_id: 96).


## Agent Execution Plan (incl. planned steps)

- Identify common characteristics of reviews where 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' is missed.
- Analyze the review text and predicted aspects for false negatives related to 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' to identify patterns in the model's errors.
- Investigate the training data to determine if there is sufficient representation of 'anecdotes/miscellaneous'.
- Examine the prompt used for aspect extraction to see if it adequately covers 'anecdotes/miscellaneous'.
- Generate new prompt-tuning examples specifically for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' to improve the model's ability to identify this aspect.
- Evaluate the performance of the model after prompt tuning on a held-out dataset.
- Investigate why 'price' is not being identified at all.
- Analyze the training data for 'price' to determine if it is adequately represented.
- Review the prompt for any biases that might prevent the identification of 'price'.
- Generate new training examples for 'price' to improve coverage.
