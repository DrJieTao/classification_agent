# Escalation Case 9

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis details are provided in the sections below (root cause & supporting evidence).


## Root cause hypothesis:

The system's overall performance is hampered by its poor ability to identify and classify 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price' aspects, as evidenced by their consistently low F1-scores of 0.4. The 'service' aspect also contributes to the lower overall score with an F1-score of 0.67.


## Supporting evidence:

- The batch summary indicates low F1-scores for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' (0.4) and 'price' (0.4).
- The batch summary highlights that the system 'struggles with anecdotes/miscellaneous and price aspects'.
- The final F1 score of 0.6533 is below the threshold of 0.75.


## Agent Execution Plan (incl. planned steps)

- Identify specific examples of reviews where the 'service' aspect was incorrectly classified (false positives and false negatives).
- Analyze the incorrectly classified 'service' reviews to identify common patterns or characteristics.
- Examine the training data for the 'service' aspect to determine if there is a lack of representative examples or biased labeling.
- Generate a new prompt-tuning example for a failed case related to the 'service' aspect.
- Evaluate the impact of the new prompt-tuning example on the system's performance for the 'service' aspect.
