  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear and data-backed, identifying specific underperforming aspects (anecdotes/miscellaneous, price, service) with corresponding F1-scores. The root cause hypothesis logically links low scores to poor classification performance and ties them to the overall score falling below the threshold. However, while the execution plan aligns well—targeting 'service' for deeper analysis—it lacks strategic novelty and a direct strategy for addressing the systemic failure in 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price'. Additionally, the ART section is incomplete, which undermines the potential for systemic improvement. The plan is coherent but lacks broader innovation or risk mitigation strategies."

  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is both coherent and evidence-rich, linking the system's false negatives in 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' to a lack of contextual understanding. The supporting evidence—moderate F1-score, illustrative false negatives, and agent feedback—creates a compelling case for a context-aware root cause. The execution plan is strategically aligned with the diagnosis, incorporating pattern analysis, prompt engineering, and model experimentation. Notably, the proposed ART (ContextualAspectExtractor) directly addresses the systemic gap with a novel, context-driven approach. It includes a clear capability gap analysis and a well-articulated docstring, demonstrating potential for systemic improvement. This makes it a high-impact, actionable solution worthy of deployment."

    "actionability_decision": "Approve for Deployment"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is robust, clearly identifying the system's limitation in extracting nuanced aspects like 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' due to overreliance on direct term mentions and insufficient contextual modeling. The evidence—moderate F1-score, illustrative false negatives, and agent feedback—is consistent and compelling. The execution plan is methodical, actionable, and directly aligned with the diagnosed issue, incorporating failure pattern analysis, contextual behavior investigation, training data review, and prompt engineering interventions. The proposed ART (ContextualAspectExtractor) is a strategic innovation that extends beyond the current case, explicitly addressing both 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price'—a broader scope than previous cases—which enhances its systemic value. With a clear capability gap analysis and well-documented intent, this ART demonstrates high potential for sustainable improvement and cross-aspect generalization."

    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear and factually grounded, identifying the low F1-scores for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous', 'price', and 'service' as key performance bottlenecks. The evidence—macro-F1 below threshold and aspect-specific scores—supports a logical root cause hypothesis. The execution plan is coherent and methodical, with steps that align well to diagnose and iteratively improve each underperforming aspect. However, the strategic impact is weakened by the lack of innovation: the plan remains reactive rather than systemic, focusing on prompt tuning without deeper architectural or data-level interventions. Additionally, the proposed ART is incomplete (missing capability gap analysis and docstring), which limits its potential for broader deployment or reuse. This omission undermines the possibility of systemic improvement and requires clarification before proceeding."

    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is precise and well-supported, identifying a clear pattern of false negatives for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' in concise or implicitly phrased reviews. The evidence—specific F1-score, illustrative examples, and feedback—creates a strong foundation for the hypothesis that the system prioritizes more explicit or dominant aspects. The execution plan is logically structured, targeting root causes from multiple angles: error pattern analysis, keyword dependency investigation, training data review, and prompt refinement. However, while methodical, the plan lacks strategic innovation beyond iterative tuning and does not propose systemic architectural or contextual modeling improvements. Additionally, the ART remains undefined, missing a critical opportunity to encode this insight into a reusable, scalable solution. Clarification is needed to complete the ART definition before deployment can be approved."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 3
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is comprehensive and strongly supported by quantitative metrics and system feedback, clearly identifying 'anecdotes/miscellaneous', 'price', and to a lesser extent 'service' as systemic underperformers. The evidence—repeated low F1-scores, explicit system feedback, and a final macro-F1 below threshold—validates the root cause hypothesis. The execution plan is logically structured, methodical, and aligned with the diagnosis, covering failure pattern analysis, data investigation, and iterative prompt tuning. However, despite its internal coherence, the plan lacks strategic innovation; it remains within a reactive tuning framework rather than proposing architectural improvements or novel modeling approaches. Moreover, the AI-generated performance summary confirms that the plan failed to yield sufficient improvement, reinforcing the need for more substantial intervention. Critically, the ART remains undefined (name, docstring, and capability gap analysis are missing), which prevents systemic application of any insights gained. Clarification and completion of the ART definition are required before deployment can be considered."

  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear, logically structured, and supported by consistent quantitative evidence—low F1-scores for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price', system feedback acknowledging these issues, and an overall macro-F1 below the required threshold. The root cause hypothesis effectively links underperformance in specific aspects to the system’s overall failure. The execution plan follows logically from the diagnosis, focusing on pattern identification, data review, and prompt tuning for the 'service' aspect. However, it lacks strategic depth and innovation, offering a narrow scope that does not extend to the more problematic 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price' categories. Furthermore, the proposed ART remains entirely undefined—missing capability gap analysis, name, and docstring—which severely limits its potential for systemic improvement or reuse. Clarification and completion of the ART definition are necessary before proceeding."

    },
    "actionability_decision": "Approve for Deployment"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is both comprehensive and strategically insightful, clearly attributing the system's failure in extracting 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' to a lack of contextual modeling and insufficient training data. The supporting evidence—low F1-score (0.5), illustrative false negatives, agent feedback, and concrete error examples like result_id: 96—builds a robust foundation for the root cause hypothesis. The execution plan is not only logically aligned with the diagnosis but demonstrates strategic depth by expanding beyond prompt tuning to include investigation into systemic issues such as data coverage and potential prompt biases. Notably, the plan also identifies an emergent issue—'price' being entirely missed—and integrates targeted remediation steps. The proposed ART, ContextualAspectIdentifier, directly addresses the diagnosed capability gap with a novel, context-aware approach that moves beyond keyword matching. Its clear docstring and capability gap analysis suggest strong potential for reusable, scalable impact across similar aspects. This case represents a high-value, actionable intervention ready for deployment."
