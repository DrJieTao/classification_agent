## New Personas Created

### **Persona Set: Expertise-Driven Profiles**

This set is designed systematically to probe the "corners" of the expertise space. Each persona is defined by a specific combination of high and low expertise levels, allowing us to isolate how different knowledge gaps affect the evaluation of the system's explanations.

| Persona Profile | LLM Expertise | Agentic Expertise | ABSA Expertise | Primary Focus of Evaluation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1: The "Pure" ABSA Specialist** | **L1 (User)** | **L1 (User)** | **L4 (Expert)** | The deep correctness of the ABSA-related diagnosis, ignoring the agentic implementation details. |
| **2: The "Pure" Agent Architect** | **L2 (Practitioner)** | **L4 (Expert)** | **L1 (Consumer)** | The logical coherence of the plan, the soundness of the proposed system change, and the strategy of the agentic workflow. |
| **3: The "Informed Stakeholder"**| **L2 (Practitioner)**| **L2 (Practitioner)**| **L1 (Consumer)**| Comprehending the reasoning and trusting the outcome without deep technical knowledge in the specific domain (ABSA). |
| **4: The "Full-Stack AI Developer"**| **L3 (Developer)** | **L3 (Developer)** | **L3 (Developer)** | The end-to-end technical quality of the diagnosis and plan. "Is this a well-reasoned and well-designed solution I could build?" |
| **5: The "Generalist Data Analyst"** | **L1 (User)** | **L1 (User)** | **L2 (Practitioner)** | The clarity and unambiguity of the instructions. "Could I execute this maintenance plan without asking for help?" |

#### **Expertise Level Definitions**
*   **LLM Expertise Levels:**
    *   **L1 (User):** Interacts with LLMs through UIs; focuses on basic prompting.
    *   **L2 (Practitioner):** Uses LLM APIs and advanced prompting techniques; understands different architectures at a high level.
    *   **L3 (Developer):** Builds applications with and can fine-tune LLMs from scratch.
    *   **L4 (Expert):** Designs novel LLM architectures and training methodologies.
*   **Agentic Expertise Levels:**
    *   **L1 (User):** Understands the outcome of agentic workflows but not their internal mechanics.
    *   **L2 (Practitioner):** Guides and configures existing agentic systems; understands the observe-think-act loop.
    *   **L3 (Developer):** Builds custom agents using frameworks like LangChain; understands agent architecture.
    *   **L4 (Expert):** Designs enterprise-level agent strategies and governance frameworks.
*   **ABSA Expertise Levels:**
    *   **L1 (Consumer):** Interprets the results of pre-made ABSA tools but does not build them.
    *   **L2 (Practitioner):** Defines relevant aspects for a domain and evaluates ABSA model performance.
    *   **L3 (Developer):** Builds custom ABSA models from scratch for challenging scenarios.
    *   **L4 (Expert):** Invents new ABSA techniques and publishes novel research in the field.



### Rationale:


*   The primary goal is a more rigorous, quasi-scientific exploration of how specific knowledge gaps impact the perception of HC-XAI artifacts.
*   This set is arguably methodologically stronger for a research paper, as it allows you to make claims like, "Our system's plans were rated as highly coherent even by users with no specific domain knowledge (Persona B2), demonstrating their intrinsic clarity."
