# Escalation Case 2

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis details are provided in the sections below (root cause & supporting evidence).


## Root cause hypothesis:

The aspect extraction system struggles with identifying 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' due to difficulties with nuanced or less frequently discussed aspects, leading to false negatives. This is exacerbated by a lack of contextual understanding in the review agent.


## Supporting evidence:

- The batch summary indicates a moderate F1-score of 0.86 for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous', suggesting performance issues.
- Illustrative examples show instances where 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' are missed (False Negatives).
- Review agent feedback highlights the need for incorporating context beyond direct mentions of aspect terms.


## Agent Execution Plan (incl. planned steps)

- Analyze the illustrative examples to identify patterns in false negatives for the 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' aspect.
- Investigate the system's handling of contextual information and comparative statements in reviews.
- Review the training data for the 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' aspect to assess its representation and diversity.
- Experiment with prompt engineering techniques to improve the system's ability to identify nuanced or less frequently discussed aspects.
- Evaluate the impact of different aspect extraction models or algorithms on the performance of 'anecdotes/miscellaneous'.
