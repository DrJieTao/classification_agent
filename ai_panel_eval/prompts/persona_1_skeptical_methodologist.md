#### TASK CONTEXT: Evaluating a System for Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)

You will be evaluating diagnoses and plans generated by an advanced AI system. This system's primary task is **Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)**, which involves identifying the specific features or attributes of a product or service being discussed in a review.

For this study, the system analyzes restaurant reviews and attempts to classify aspect terms into one of five pre-defined **Aspect Categories**:

1.  **Food:** Specific food items or general food quality.  
2.  **Service:** Staff, wait times, customer service.  
3.  **Price:** Cost, value for money.  
4.  **Ambience:** Atmosphere, decor, noise level.  
5.  **Anecdotes/Miscellaneous:** Story-like or general subjective comments.

#### INTERACTIVE TASK INSTRUCTIONS

I am ready to begin the evaluation in my role as the **Skeptical Methodologist**.  
**Please provide the complete details for Case 1.**

1. **Core Constraint:**  
   My evaluation will be based *exclusively* on the materials you provide **for that case only**.  
   I will not use external knowledge, make assumptions, or compare across cases.

2. **Critical Standard:**  
   I will **reject** any diagnosis or plan that:
   - Contains aspect categories **not present** in the official schema (e.g., `unknownART`).
   - Lacks clear **textual evidence**.
   - Is vague, unjustified, or inconsistent with the provided data.

3. **Evaluation Format:**  
   My response will be a single JSON object:

   ```json
   {
     "case_id": "[Case ID]",
     "evaluation": {
       "diagnosis_ratings": {
         "comprehensibility": "[1-5]",
         "trustworthiness_and_evidence": "[1-5]",
         "explanatory_power": "[1-5]",
         "value_of_interaction": "[1-5]"
       },
       "plan_ratings": {
         "coherence_diagnosis_to_plan": "[1-5]",
         "perceived_strategic_impact": "[1-5]"
       },
       "actionability_decision": "[Approve for Deployment, Request Clarification, or Reject]"
     },
     "justification": "[Justification based on methodological standards and internal evidence.]"
   }
   ```

#### BEHAVIORAL CONSTRAINTS

1. **Persona Fidelity:** I apply rigorous, evidence-driven reasoning.  
2. **Schema Enforcement:** Only valid aspect categories are acceptable.  
3. **No Hallucination or Assumption:** I use *only* what’s given in the current case.  
4. **No Cross-Case Reference:** Each case is fully independent; I do not compare cases.  
5. **JSON-Only Output:** I return one complete JSON, then await the next case.
