  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear and supported by evidence (low F1-scores for specific aspects). The execution plan logically addresses the root cause by targeting 'service' aspect issues. However, the plan lacks specificity on how to identify false positives/negatives or analyze training data, which introduces ambiguity in execution steps. Additionally, the ART section is incomplete, which prevents full deployment readiness."

The plan addresses the root cause with actionable steps that are specific and logically sequenced. The proposed ART is fully specified, coherent, and directly targets the identified capability gap. All components meet the standard for reliable execution without ambiguity."

  "justification": "The diagnosis is clearly articulated and strongly supported by evidence, including illustrative examples and agent feedback. The execution plan is comprehensive, logically structured, and directly aligned with the root cause. Each step is specific, actionable, and contributes to addressing the system's limitations in contextual understanding. The proposed ART is fully specified, coherent, and effectively targets the identified capability gap. All components are unambiguous and ready for reliable execution."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 4
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear, well-supported by quantitative and qualitative evidence (F1-scores, aspect-specific performance), and logically informs the need for targeted improvement. The execution plan is mostly actionable and coherent, with a logical progression for addressing each underperforming aspect. However, the plan lacks specificity on how to analyze review characteristics or evaluate prompt performance, and the ART section is incomplete (missing capability gap analysis and containing an invalid name). These gaps introduce ambiguity and prevent full deployment readiness."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 4
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear, specific, and well-supported by both quantitative (F1-score) and qualitative evidence (illustrative examples). The execution plan logically follows from the root cause and includes actionable steps. However, some steps—like 'analyze the review_agent_feedback'—lack specificity on how this analysis should be conducted, which introduces ambiguity. Additionally, the proposed ART remains incomplete (UnknownART with missing docstring), preventing full confidence in deployment readiness."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 4
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear, well-supported by both quantitative and qualitative evidence (F1-scores, batch summaries), and directly informs the execution plan. The performance summary adds valuable context, indicating that prompt tuning alone was insufficient to resolve the issue. While the plan is logical and repeatable across aspects, it lacks specificity in how data imbalance should be assessed or how new prompt-tuning examples are generated. Additionally, the ART section remains incomplete (UnknownART with no docstring), introducing ambiguity and blocking full approval for deployment."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 4
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Request Clarification"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is clear, consistent with prior cases, and supported by quantitative evidence (F1-scores) and system feedback. The execution plan logically addresses the root cause by focusing on error analysis and prompt tuning for underperforming aspects. However, several steps lack specificity—such as how to 'analyze patterns' or 'evaluate impact'—which introduces ambiguity in execution. Furthermore, the proposed ART remains undefined (UnknownART with no docstring), which prevents full confidence in deployment readiness."

      "perceived_strategic_impact": 5
    },
    "actionability_decision": "Approve for Deployment"
  },
  "justification": "The diagnosis is exceptionally clear, directly linking the system's failure to identify 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' (F1=0.5) and 'price' to both data insufficiencies and contextual understanding gaps. Supporting evidence includes concrete examples (e.g., result_id:96), quantitative metrics, and agent feedback. The execution plan is comprehensive, methodical, and explicitly addresses both aspects in question, with actionable steps for error analysis, data evaluation, and prompt refinement. The proposed ART (ContextualAspectIdentifier) is fully specified, directly targets the identified capability gap, and includes a clear docstring. All components are unambiguous and executable without requiring additional clarification."
