# Escalation Case 8

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis details are provided in the sections below (root cause & supporting evidence).


## Root cause hypothesis:

The system's overall performance is hampered by its poor ability to identify and classify 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price' aspects, as evidenced by their consistently low F1-scores of 0.4. The 'service' aspect also contributes to the lower overall score with an F1-score of 0.67.


## Supporting evidence:

- The batch summary indicates low F1-scores for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' (0.4) and 'price' (0.4).
- The batch summary highlights that the system 'struggles with anecdotes/miscellaneous and price aspects'.
- The final F1 score of 0.6533 is below the threshold of 0.75.


## Agent Execution Plan (incl. planned steps)

- Identify specific examples of reviews where the 'service' aspect was incorrectly classified (false positives and false negatives).
- Analyze the incorrectly classified 'service' reviews to identify common patterns or characteristics.
- Investigate the training data for the 'service' aspect to determine if there is a class imbalance or lack of representative examples.
- Generate new prompt-tuning examples specifically addressing the identified failure cases for the 'service' aspect.
- Evaluate the performance of the system after prompt tuning on a held-out validation set.
- Repeat steps 1-5 for the 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price' aspects.


## AI-Generated Performance Summary

- **executive_summary**: The aspect extraction system failed to meet the required F1-score threshold of 0.75, achieving only 0.6533. The primary root cause is the system's difficulty in accurately identifying and classifying 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price' aspects, which exhibit consistently low F1-scores of 0.4. Performance on 'service' is also a contributing factor. The execution plan focused on identifying failure cases, analyzing patterns, and generating prompt-tuning examples, but ultimately did not resolve the issue, indicating a potential need for more substantial model adjustments or data augmentation.
- **tier1_findings**: The system's overall performance in aspect extraction is below expectations, with a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.65. While the system performs well on 'ambience' and 'food', it struggles significantly with 'anecdotes/miscellaneous', 'price', and 'service'. The final F1 score falls short of the predefined threshold of 0.75.
- **tier2_diagnosis_overview**: The root cause of the failure is attributed to the system's inability to accurately classify 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price' aspects, as evidenced by their low F1-scores. The 'service' aspect also contributes to the overall performance decline. This suggests potential issues with the training data, prompt design, or model architecture related to these specific categories.
- **plan_execution_outcome**: An execution plan was generated and implemented, focusing on targeted improvements to the 'service', 'anecdotes/miscellaneous', and 'price' aspects. The plan involved identifying failure cases, analyzing patterns, and generating prompt-tuning examples. However, despite these efforts, the system's performance did not improve sufficiently to meet the required threshold.
- **next_steps_recommendations**: • Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons for the poor performance on 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price'.
• Consider augmenting the training data with more representative examples of these challenging aspect categories.
• Explore alternative prompt designs or model architectures that may be better suited for handling these aspects.
• A more comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance on a wider range of datasets is recommended.
