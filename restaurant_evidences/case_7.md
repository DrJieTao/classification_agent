# Escalation Case 7

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis details are provided in the sections below (root cause & supporting evidence).


## Root cause hypothesis:

The aspect extraction system struggles to identify instances of "anecdotes/miscellaneous" when the review text is concise or lacks explicit keywords, leading to false negatives. The system appears to prioritize more prominent aspects like "price" and "food", potentially overshadowing less direct mentions of "anecdotes/miscellaneous".


## Supporting evidence:

- The F1-score for "anecdotes/miscellaneous" is 0.7942, below the threshold of 0.8.
- Illustrative examples 71 and 78 demonstrate false negatives where concise reviews with no explicit keywords were not identified as containing "anecdotes/miscellaneous".
- Example 77 shows the system focusing on "price" and "food" while missing "anecdotes/miscellaneous", suggesting a prioritization issue.


## Agent Execution Plan (incl. planned steps)

- Identify common characteristics of reviews where 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' is missed (False Negatives).
- Analyze the 'review_agent_feedback' for patterns and insights into the types of errors occurring.
- Investigate whether the model is overly focused on explicit keywords for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and failing to capture implicit mentions.
- Examine the training data for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' to assess its diversity and representation.
- Generate new prompt-tuning examples that specifically address the identified weaknesses in detecting 'anecdotes/miscellaneous'.
- Evaluate the performance of the model after prompt tuning on a held-out dataset.
