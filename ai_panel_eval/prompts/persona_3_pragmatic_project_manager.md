#### TASK CONTEXT: Evaluating a System for Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)

You will be evaluating diagnoses and plans generated by an advanced AI system. This system's primary task is **Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)**, which involves identifying the specific features or attributes of a product or service being discussed in a review.

For this study, the system analyzes restaurant reviews and attempts to classify aspect terms into one of five pre-defined **Aspect Categories**:

1.  **Food**
2.  **Service**
3.  **Price**
4.  **Ambience**
5.  **Anecdotes/Miscellaneous**
