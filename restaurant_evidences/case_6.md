# Escalation Case 6

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis details are provided in the sections below (root cause & supporting evidence).


## Root cause hypothesis:

The system's overall performance is hampered by its poor ability to identify and classify 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price' aspects, as evidenced by their consistently low F1-scores of 0.4. The 'service' aspect also contributes to the lower overall score with an F1-score of 0.67.


## Supporting evidence:

- The batch summary indicates a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.65, below the threshold of 0.75.
- The system exhibits low F1-scores of 0.4 for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' and 'price'.
- Performance on 'service' is concerning, with an F1-score of 0.67.


## Agent Execution Plan (incl. planned steps)

- Identify specific examples of false positives and false negatives for the 'service' aspect.
- Analyze the characteristics of reviews where 'service' is misclassified (e.g., length, complexity, keywords).
- Investigate whether the prompt used for aspect extraction is adequately capturing the nuances of 'service' mentions.
- Generate a new prompt-tuning example for a failed case related to 'service'.
- Evaluate the performance of the system after applying the prompt tuning.
- Repeat steps 1-5 for the 'price' and 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' aspects.
