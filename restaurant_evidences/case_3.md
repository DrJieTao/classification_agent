# Escalation Case 3

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis details are provided in the sections below (root cause & supporting evidence).


## Root cause hypothesis:

The aspect extraction system struggles with nuanced or less frequently discussed aspects like 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' due to a reliance on direct mentions of aspect terms and a lack of contextual understanding.


## Supporting evidence:

- The batch summary indicates a moderate F1-score of 0.86 for 'anecdotes/miscellaneous', suggesting difficulties with this aspect.
- Illustrative examples show false negatives where 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' was present but not predicted.
- Review agent feedback highlights the need for incorporating context beyond direct mentions of aspect terms.


## Agent Execution Plan (incl. planned steps)

- Analyze the provided illustrative examples to identify patterns in false negative errors for the 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' aspect.
- Investigate the system's handling of contextual information and comparative statements within reviews.
- Examine the training data for the 'anecdotes/miscellaneous' aspect to assess its representation and diversity.
- Evaluate the impact of prompt engineering on the system's ability to identify nuanced aspects like 'anecdotes/miscellaneous'.
- Generate new prompt-tuning examples specifically targeting the identified failure patterns.
- Retest the system with the updated prompts and evaluate performance improvements.
